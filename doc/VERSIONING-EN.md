# How my versioning works

I am totally against the grain in several points about `software` engineering. I do not believe
that qualitity assurance in a project is about having recurring versions that do not add
any new feature, or still recurring versions that only carry `bugfixes`.

A project with recurring versions that do not have anything new is totally pointless.
If there is nothing new to offer, why release this? Nonsense, go do other things.

A project with nothing new that keeps releasing new versions year after year having only
`bugfixes`, maybe it is a sign of how poorly done or not very competent are the folks
behind a project like that.

My business is achieving a status in things that I propose myself doing in that everything
become stable and complete. In a way that I do not need to release any new version anymore.
I pursue perfection in things that I do, I know that it is impossible, but it is a thing that
must be pursued if you want to get the things really done and ending up cycles in your life.
By thinking on solutions in a general way, no sloppy workarounds.

Does exist beautiest thing than a `wheel`, a `stratocaster`, a `telecaster`, a `les paul` or
the conceptual base of a `unix`? The World changes around those things but they stay solemn and
unquestionably complete on doing the work that they were made for.

My versioning is thought out to stop out this kind of development driven by overkill, messes
or makeshift that industry culturally imposes. It gets the developer far away from the weight
of pursuing perfection. Due to it I abandoned "fancy" names, minor and patch versions. Just
because a thing is impossible, it does not mean you have an alibi to perform badly. To err
is human, but we must not get used to it. The err is comprehensible, even so it is a bad
thing that must be avoided. A good way of avoidance it is getting near to perfection by pursuing
the perfection.

Here a version is: `v<integer-number-from-one-to-infinite>`.

When a version `vN` is released, it is tagged. Once tagged, it turns into stone and never ever
in the Human history it will get new `commits` or it will be "retagged". It is unacceptable.

New versions are developed in the branch `next` (I usually create it from `main` when I
really have something to do as a new version, by the way, I hate it, because it signs that
I was incompetent at the last version on bringing a real complete thing, but having stuff
to be done, let's go...)

Do not having new features nor bugs to fix, it is only about using it, thinking on new projects
and live! :wink:

**Again**: if you arrive here and realize that a new version is not released a long time ago,
it means that Rafael and contributors are in a stage that everything is stable, they are doing
a great job, in a masterful way! :sunglasses: Perhaps you are in front of a `software` that
insists on working and due to it, this `software` is `low-profile` when talking about new
versions. Who knows it has already turned into a wheel in terms of `software`!

Live long and prosper, current version! :vulcan_salute:
