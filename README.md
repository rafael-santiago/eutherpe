# Eutherpe

`Eutherpe` is a kind of `ethereal` jukebox wiring. This is the base of `Euther Pi` what is a `diy` project for bringing back
the pleasant ritual of listening to music outside from a flat well-behaved computer system. The essence here is avoid being
attached to screens and buttons, subscriptions, advertisements, nosy suggestions and, blah-blah-blah. Let's stop all this shit
and listening to the tunes that we love. This is the invite of `Eutherpe` and `Euther Pi`  do for you. With `Eutherpe` we are
able to make a `self-hosted` music stream service to play music in your home. All you just do is feeding `Eutherpe` with your
`MP3/4` library connect it in a bluetooth speaker/phone and go have fun.

You do not need to build up `Eutherpe` into a `Raspberry Pi` but it is a very neat task to do and I hope you would love to have
this nice little `ethereal` jukebox (not tapped) device in your home. If you are interested, you can follow up all steps to do it
at `Euther-Pi` repo.

However, firstly I would suggest you to know all single thing about `Eutherpe` by starting from [here]().

Enjoy!
